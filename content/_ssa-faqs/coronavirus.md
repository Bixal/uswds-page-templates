question: Are Social Security services affected by Coronavirus (COVID-19)?
---
We are still able to provide critical services. Please note that all local Social Security offices are closed for walk-in service, though an in-person appointment may be possible. This decision protects the population we serve - older Americans and people with underlying medical conditions - and our employees during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Our local office employees are answering calls to their office and our telephone representatives are answering calls to our National 800 Number. Our website offers many safe and secure self-help services and a wealth of information to help you.

Please read our [Coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://www.ssa.gov/coronavirus) information page to learn more, including how to get help from the Social Security Administration by phone and online.
