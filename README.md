# USWDS Page Templates

On the [Rapid Response Team](https://github.com/Bixal/rapid-response-team/wiki) at [Bixal](https://www.bixal.com/), we believe fast cycles of prototyping and testing accelerate alignment, reduce risk, and improve outcomes. We started a dedicated internal team to explore new processes and tools for using web-based prototyping to help our delivery teams lower the barriers to making ideas more tangible more quickly. With our focus on speed, tangibility, reusability, and openness, we demonstrate what's possible with rapid prototyping, lean research, content libraries, and design frameworks.

To support these efforts, we started building out a library of page templates based on the [U.S. Web System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) to help jumpstart our prototypes and projects. 

USWDS Page Templates includes examples of common page types that we see across our projects. We drew inspiration from the existing [USWDS templates](https://designsystem.digital.gov/templates/) and [Flowmapp "covers"](https://www.flowmapp.com/features/custom-page-covers) as a starting point, but we're open to including any and everything that could be useful. 

These are the principles that our guide our approach to page templates:

- **Use real content**: We want to see how these pages look and function in the real world.
- **Separate code from content**: We want to empower team members to prototype in parallel and quickly adapt templates to different needs.
- **Stick to default styling and utility classes**: We want to spend more time building and testing ideas and less time fiddling and compiling.
- **Start with responsiveness and accessibility**: We want to design for the web medium from the beginning by accounting for a diversity of devices and situations.

We'd love to hear your feedback! Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Bixal/uswds-page-templates/issues) or [contact us](https://www.bixal.com/#contact).
