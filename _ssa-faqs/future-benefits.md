question: How can I get a Social Security Statement that shows a record of my earnings and an estimate of my future benefits?
---
You can get your personal *Social Security Statement* online by using your [my Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/signin) account. If you don't yet have an account, you can easily create one. Your online *Statement *gives you secure and convenient access to your earnings records. It also shows estimates for retirement, disability and survivors benefits you and your family may be eligible for.

To set up or use your account to get your online *Social Security Statement*, go to *[Sign In Or Create An Account](https://www.ssa.gov/signin).*

We also mail paper *Statements* to workers age 60 and older three months before their birthday if they don't receive Social Security benefits and don't yet have a [my Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/) account. Workers who don't want to wait for their scheduled mailing can request their *Social Security Statement* by [following these instructions](https://www.socialsecurity.gov/hlp/global/hlp-statement-7004-revi.htm). The *Statement* will arrive by mail in four to six weeks.
