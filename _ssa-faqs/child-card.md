question: How do I replace a Social Security card for a child?
---
To replace a Social Security card for a child:

**Step 1**: Gather documents proving your:

- Child's Identity;
- U.S. citizenship if you have not established the child's U.S. citizenship with us; and
- Immigration status if the child is not a U.S. citizen.

**Step 2**: Gather documents proving your:

- Identity; and
- Custody/relationship for the child.

**Step 3**: Complete an Application for a Social Security card.

**Step 4**: Take or mail the completed application and documents to your local Social Security office or your local Social Security Card Center.

All documents must be either originals or certified copies by the issuing agency. We cannot accept photocopies or notarized copies of documents. Any documents you mail to us will be returned to you along with a receipt.

**Important Information**

We will mail your card as soon as we have verified all required documents. You should receive the card within 10 business days from the date on the receipt. The replacement card will have the same number as the previous card.

You may not need to get a replacement card. Knowing the Social Security number is what is important. You need a Social Security number to get a job, collect Social Security benefits and receive some government services but you do not often need to show your Social Security card.
