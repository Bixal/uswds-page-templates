question: How do I apply for a new or replacement Social Security number card?

You can get an original Social Security card or a replacement card if yours is lost or stolen. There is no charge for a Social Security card. This service is free.

You can use a [my Social Security](http://www.ssa.gov/myaccount) account to request a replacement Social Security card online if you:

-   Are a U.S. citizen age 18 years or older with a U.S. mailing address;
-   Are not requesting a name change or any other change to your card; and
-   Have a driver's license or a state-issued identification card from one of the many participating states. If your state [does not yet participate](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/#issnrc) in this service, check back soon. More states are added regularly.

If you cannot apply for a card online, you will need to show the required documents.  We need to see different documents depending on your citizenship and the type of card you are requesting. See [Learn What Documents You Need](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ss5doc.htm) to find out what documents you will have to show. Fill out and print an [Application for a Social Security Card](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf); and mail your application and documents to your local Social Security office.

Please read our [Coronavirus (COVID-19) information page](https://www.ssa.gov/coronavirus/#ssn) to learn about changes to Social Security number card requests during the COVID-19 pandemic.
