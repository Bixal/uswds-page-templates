question: How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?
---
If you legally change your name because of marriage, divorce, court order or any other reason, you must tell Social Security so you can get a corrected card. You cannot apply for a card online. There is no charge for a Social Security card. This service is free. The same applies once you receive the I-766 card, Employment Authorization Document (EAD), from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and bring required evidence.  See [Defining the legal Name for an SSN](https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0110212001).\
To get a corrected Social Security card, you will need to:

-   Show the required documents. You will need proof of your identity. Sometimes you also may need to prove your current U.S. citizenship or lawful noncitizen status. See [Learn What Documents You Need](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ss5doc.htm) for more information. Under the heading, "*Type of Card*," select "*Corrected"* for a list of the documents you need;
-   Fill out and print an [Application for a Social Security Card](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf); and
-   Mail your application and documents to your [local Social Security office](https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp).

For complete instructions, please go to [Social Security Number and Card](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/).\
